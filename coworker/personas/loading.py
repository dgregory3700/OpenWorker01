"""Third-party persona loading + install-time capability consent.

A persona is loaded from a local directory or a git URL. Because a persona ships no executable
code (it only references vetted catalog capabilities, connectors, and MCP servers), "installing"
one is a light trust event: we compute a **consent summary** of what it will be able to do
(tools, risk classes, connectors, MCP, messaging, recommended mode) and the user approves that
before the persona is enabled. Loading never writes risk overrides or elevates any mode.
