"""`openworker machine sandbox status|setup`: get a machine ready to run agents in
OpenShell sandboxes (design doc, ruling 23).

`setup` shows every change before it makes it and asks first (or `--yes`). Someone who
brings their own OpenShell can ignore `setup` and use `status` to see what is missing.

The same steps serve Settings ▸ Sandbox (OPE-207): `steps()` is the readiness list the page
shows, and `setup_job.SetupJob` runs the fixes, with progress. One list of checks and fixes,
two front ends.

Two steps need an administrator on Linux: installing the OpenShell package, and `linger`
(the gateway is a user service and stops at logout otherwise). The app runs them itself
when it can do so without holding a password: through `sudo` when this user may use it
without one, or through the system's own password prompt (`pkexec`) on a Linux desktop.
Where neither exists (WSL has no prompt), the two are folded into ONE command for the
user to run, and the job stops there until "check again". A Mac needs no administrator:
Homebrew installs OpenShell as the user, and there is no linger. The app never asks for,
sees or stores a password.

Hidden from `openworker --help` until it has been tried on a fresh machine.
