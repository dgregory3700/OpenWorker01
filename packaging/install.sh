# OpenWorker headless installer — Linux and macOS.
#
#   curl -fsSL https://openworker.com/install.sh | sh
#
# Installs the `openworker` command for the current user (no sudo). Re-run it to upgrade.
#
# On Linux (x86_64, aarch64; glibc 2.31 or newer) it downloads the `openworker` program from
# the GitHub release, checks its SHA-256, unpacks it into ~/.local/share/openworker and links
# it into ~/.local/bin. No Python is needed.
#
# Elsewhere (macOS, other Linux) it installs the Python package: with `uv` when present,
# `pipx` when that is what the machine has, and otherwise it installs `uv` first (uv brings
# its own Python, so the system's Python version does not matter).
#
# Settings (environment variables):
#   OPENWORKER_VERSION       install this exact version (default: the latest)
#   OPENWORKER_INSTALL       "program" or "python" to choose the route (default: automatic)
#   OPENWORKER_PACKAGE       the Python route: what to install (default: "openworker";
#                            a wheel path or URL also works)
#   OPENWORKER_DOWNLOAD_URL  the program route: where the release files are (default: the
#                            GitHub release; for mirrors and tests)
#
# The whole script is one function called on the last line, so a download that is cut off
# half-way runs nothing.
